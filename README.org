* eee.el: Extended Emacs With External Tui application

eee.el launches excellent terminal user interface tools (such as yazi, fzf, lazy-git, etc.) with Emacs asynchronously. It is very fast and does not burden Emacs.

ee.el Support:
1. [[https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/][yazi]] : launch yazi from Emacs asynchronously, then yazi tell emacs which file to open
2. [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/][ripgrep]] : launch ripgrep + fzf from Emacs asynchronous, then ripgrep tell emacs jump to which file and position
3. [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/][fzf]] : combined with  =ripgrep= 
4. [[https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit][lazygit]] : launch =lazygit= from Emacs asynchronously
5. ripgrep-all: search pdf files by =ee-rga=
6. delta: show git delta  by  =ee-delta= 
7. htop: launch htop by  =ee-htop= 
7. btop: launch btop by  =ee-btop= 
... more tui tools and options will be enhanced and provided.

** Note

=ee-find= need =devicon-lookup= (https://github.com/coreyja/devicon-lookup) to display file icons.
We should install =devicon-lookup= executable by:

=cargo install devicon-lookup --force=

    :bind-keymap
    ("s-e" . ee-keymap)
    )
#+end_src
